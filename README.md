# Advent of Code 2023: Day 3
Github Copilot and Bart Massey

---

Went through *many* iterations on Part 1. After watching
Copilot's pattern of mistakes, gave it a modified algorithm
to try. This generated correct code. Honestly, don't really
count this as a success, as way too much manual fiddling and
checking was needed.

Part 2 was easier for Copilot. Pointed out one mistake in
Copilot's algorithm, which it immediately fixed, giving
correct code.
